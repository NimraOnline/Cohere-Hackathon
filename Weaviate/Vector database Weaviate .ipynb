The Meaning of As-Sirat Al-Mustaqim, the Straight Path...As for the meaning of As-Sirat Al-Mustaqim, Imam Abu Ja`far At-Tabari said, \\\"The Ummah agreed that Sirat Al-Mustaqim, is the clear path without branches, according to the language of the Arabs For instance, Jarir bin `Atiyah Al-Khatafi said in a poem, `The Leader of the faithful is on a path that will remain straight even though the other paths are crooked At-Tabari also stated that, \\\"There are many evidences to this fact At-Tabari then proceeded, \\\"The Arabs use the term, Sirat in reference to every deed and statement whether righteous or wicked Hence the Arabs would describe the honest person as being straight and the wicked person as being crooked The straight path mentioned in the Quran refers to Islam..Imam Ahmad recorded in his Musnad that An-Nawwas bin Sam`an said that the Prophet said, : : : : \\\"Allah has set an example: a Sirat (straight path.\\\" that is surrounded by two walls on both sides, with several open doors within the walls covered with curtains There is a caller on the gate of the Sirat who heralds, O people! Stay on the path and do not deviate from it Meanwhile, a caller from above the path is also warning any person who wants to open any of these doors, Woe unto you! Do not open it, for if you open it you will pass through The straight path is Islam, the two walls are Allahs set limits, while the doors resemble what Allah has prohibited The caller on the gate of the Sirat is the Book of Allah, while the caller above the Sirat is Allahs admonishment in the heart of every Muslim.) The Faithful ask for and abide by Guidance..If someone asks, \\\"Why does the believer ask Allah for guidance during every prayer and at other times, while he is already properly guided Has he not already acquired guidance.The answer to these questions is that if it were not a fact that the believer needs to keep asking for guidance day and night, Allah would not have directed him to invoke Him to acquire the guidance The\"\n",

(9: 61).Prophet Yusufs brothers said to their father, \\\"But you will never believe us even when we speak the truth.\\\" (12:17)..Further, the word Iman is sometimes mentioned along with deeds, such as Allah said, \\\"Save those who believe (in Islamic Monotheism.\\\" and do righteous deeds) (95:6)..However, when Iman is used in an unrestricted manner, it includes beliefs, deeds, and statements of the tongue.We should state here that Iman increases and decreases..There are many narrations and Hadiths on this subject, and we discussed them in the beginning of our explanation of Sahih Al-Bukhari, all favors are from Allah Some scholars explained that Iman means Khashyah (fear of Allah) For instance, Allah said; \\\"Verily, those who fear their Lord unseen (i.e they do not see Him, nor His punishment in the Hereafter.\\\") (67:12), and, \\\"Who feared the Most Gracious (Allah.\\\" in the Ghayb (unseen) and brought a heart turned in repentance (to Him and absolutely free from every kind of polytheism)) (50: 33)..Fear is the core of Iman and knowledge, just as Allah the Exalted said, \\\"It is only those who have knowledge among His servants that fear Allah.\\\" (35:28). The Meaning of Al-Ghayb..As for the meaning of Ghayb here, the Salaf have different explanations of it, all of which are correct, indicating the same general meaning For instance, Abu Ja`far Ar-Razi quoted Ar-Rabi` bin Anas, reporting from Abu Al-`Aliyah about Allahs statement, i \\\"(Those who.\\\" have faith in the Ghayb), \\\"They believe in Allah, His angels, Books, Messengers, the Last Day, His Paradise, Fire and in the meeting with Him They also believe in life after death and in Resurrection All of this is the Ghayb Qatadah bin Di`amah said similarly..Sa`id bin Mansur reported from `Abdur-Rahman bin Yazid who said, \\\"We were sitting with `Abdullah bin Mas`ud when we mentioned the Companions of the Prophet and their\"\n",

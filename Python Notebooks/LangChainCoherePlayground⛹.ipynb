The Letters at the Beginning of Surahs..If one removes the repetitive letters, then the number of letters mentioned at the beginning of the Surahs is fourteen: Alif, Lam, Mim, Sad, Ra, Kaf, Ha, Ya, `Ayn, Ta, Sin, Ha, Qaf, Nun..So glorious is He Who made everything subtly reflect His wisdom..Moreover, the scholars said, \\\"There is no doubt that Allah did not reveal these letters for jest and play Some ignorant people said that some of the Quran does not mean anything, (meaning, such as these letters) thus committing a major mistake On the contrary, these letters carry a specific meaning Further, if we find an authentic narration leading to the Prophet that explains these letters, we will embrace the Prophets statement Otherwise, we will stop where we were made to stop and will proclaim, \\\"We believe in it; all of it (clear and unclear verses.\\\" is from our Lord) (3:7)..The scholars did not agree on one opinion or explanation regarding this subject Therefore, whoever thinks that one scholars opinion is correct, he is obliged to follow it, otherwise it is better to refrain from making any judgment on this matter Allah knows best. These Letters testify to the Miraculous Quran..The wisdom behind mentioning these letters in the beginning of the Surahs, regardless of the exact meanings of these letters, is that they testify to the miracle of the Quran Indeed, the servants are unable to produce something like the Quran, although it is comprised of the same letters with which they speak to each other This opinion was mentioned by Ar-Razi in his Tafsir who related it to Al-Mubarrid and several other scholars Al-Qurtubi also related this opinion to Al-Farra and Qutrub Az-Zamakhshari agreed with this opinion in his book, Al-Kashshaf In addition, the Imam and scholar Abu Al-`Abbas Ibn Taymiyyah and our Shaykh Al-Hafiz Abu Al-Hajjaj Al-Mizzi agreed with this opinion Al-Mizzi told me that it is also the opinion of Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah KAz-Zamakhshari said that these letters, \\\"Were not all mentioned once in\"\n",
